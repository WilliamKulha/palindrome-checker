## Description

_User enters a sentence_\
_Page takes that string, stores it as a variable, removes punctuation, and splits the string into individual characters_\
_This output is stored as variable before it is split back into an array, reversed and joined again_\
_The two results are compared and if they are the same the page tells the user the input is a palindrome._\
_If they're different the page tells the user that the input is not a palindrome._
